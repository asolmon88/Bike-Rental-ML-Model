# Bike Rental Machine Learning Models

## Description

For this coursework, a dataset was given to students. This data set corresponds to the number of rental bikes out at each hour, combined with other features such as temperature, humidity, season, etc.

The goal was to use 2 machine learning models and test how well they predict the number of rented bikes at each hour based on other given features.

The report done for the coursework can be found [here](./Bike_Rental_Report.pdf). Everything is explained there with great detail. Also the code can be found [here](./Coursework.ipynb). It is a jupyter notebook and everything regarding the code is there.

**NOTE: This project was not originally uploaded to this github thus the lack of commits.**
